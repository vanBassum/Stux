# Stux

*Start structured. Make it your own.*

Stux is a flexible foundation for building embedded applications on ESP32. It gives you a clean, modular starting point with WiFi, a web UI, OTA updates, MQTT with Home Assistant auto-discovery, and the infrastructure to grow your project without fighting your own codebase.

It's not a framework that forces you into rigid patterns. It's a well-organized starting point that you copy, rename, and shape into whatever you're building.

### The key separation

| Folder | Contains | Changes when you... |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| `hardware/` | Pin definitions, board-specific drivers, display/peripheral setup | Swap the board or add a peripheral |
| `Application/` | Managers, business logic, orchestration, commands | Add features or change behavior |
| `lib/` | RTOS wrappers, JSON, time utilities | Rarely — these are stable building blocks |

**Rule of thumb:** if the code changes when you swap the board, it belongs in `hardware/`. If it changes when you add a feature, it belongs in `Application/`.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [ESP-IDF v6.0+](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/)
- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

Or use the included dev container (requires Docker + VS Code with the Dev Containers extension).

### Build & Flash

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

If [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is installed, the frontend is built automatically as part of `idf.py build`. The React app is compiled, gzipped, and embedded into a FAT partition on flash. No SD card or external storage needed.

If pnpm is not available, the firmware still builds — you just won't have a web UI until you build the frontend manually (`cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm build`) and reflash.

### Flash from Browser (no toolchain needed)

If you just want to flash a pre-built release without installing ESP-IDF, you can use the **ESP Web Flasher** directly from your browser:

1. Download the latest `Stux-factory.bin` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vanBassum/Stux/releases)
2. Open [ESP Web Flasher](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/)
3. Connect your ESP32 via USB
4. Select the serial port, set flash offset to `0x0`, and upload the factory binary
5. Click **Program** — done

This works in Chrome and Edge. No drivers or build tools required.

### Development

For frontend development with hot reload against a running device:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Vite's dev server will proxy WebSocket connections to the device. Edit React components and see changes instantly.

---

## Architecture

All managers follow the same pattern: they receive a `ServiceProvider&` reference at construction and initialize via `Init()`. This gives you dependency injection without a framework.

```
ApplicationContext (owns everything)
├── LogManager          — Captures ESP-IDF logs, broadcasts via WebSocket
├── SettingsManager     — NVS read/write with typed accessors
├── NetworkManager      — WiFi STA/AP with retry and fallback
│   └── WiFiInterface   — ESP WiFi abstraction (swappable for Ethernet)
├── TimeManager         — SNTP time sync with timezone support
├── CommandManager      — Routes JSON commands to handlers
├── MqttManager         — MQTT client with Home Assistant auto-discovery
├── UpdateManager       — OTA writes to app or www partition
└── WebServerManager    — HTTP + WebSocket server, static file serving
    ├── StaticFileHandler
    └── WebSocketHandler
```

### Boot sequence (main.cpp)

```cpp
// Status LED: fast blink while booting
g_statusLed.Init();
g_statusLed.SetPattern(StatusLed::Pattern::FastBlink);

// Core services
g_appContext.getLogManager().Init();
g_appContext.getSettingsManager().Init();
g_appContext.getNetworkManager().Init();
g_appContext.getTimeManager().Init();

// Application services
g_appContext.getCommandManager().Init();
g_appContext.getMqttManager().Init();
g_appContext.getUpdateManager().Init();
g_appContext.getWebServerManager().Init();

// LED indicates WiFi state
if (g_appContext.getNetworkManager().IsAccessPoint())
    g_statusLed.SetPattern(StatusLed::Pattern::SlowBlink);
else
    g_statusLed.SetPattern(StatusLed::Pattern::Solid);
```

---

## Home Assistant Integration

When MQTT is enabled and a broker is configured, Stux automatically publishes [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery) messages. Your device appears in Home Assistant without manual configuration.

**Built-in entities:**

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| IP Address | Sensor | Device IP (diagnostic) |
| WiFi Signal | Sensor | RSSI in dBm (diagnostic) |
| Uptime | Sensor | Seconds since boot (diagnostic) |
| Free Heap | Sensor | Available RAM in bytes (diagnostic) |
| Reboot | Button | Restart the device remotely |

Projects can publish additional entities by calling `MqttManager::Publish()` and adding discovery configs in `PublishDiscovery()`.

**MQTT Settings** (configurable via web UI):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `mqtt.enabled` | off | Enable MQTT connection |
| `mqtt.broker` | — | Broker hostname or IP |
| `mqtt.port` | 1883 | Broker port |
| `mqtt.user` | — | Username (optional) |
| `mqtt.pass` | — | Password (optional) |
| `mqtt.prefix` | stux | Topic prefix (`{prefix}/{device_id}/...`) |

**Topic structure:**

```
{prefix}/{device_id}/status    → "online" / "offline" (LWT)
{prefix}/{device_id}/state     → JSON with sensor values
{prefix}/{device_id}/set/#     → Incoming commands (e.g. set/reboot)
```

---

## OTA Updates

After initial USB flash, the device can be updated entirely over the web UI:

- **Firmware > Application Firmware** — Writes to the inactive OTA slot, then reboots into it
- **Firmware > WWW Partition** — Updates the web UI independently of firmware

The CI pipeline produces three artifacts per release:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Stux-factory.bin` | Full image (bootloader + partitions + app + www) for initial flash |
| `Stux-app.bin` | Firmware only, for OTA update via web UI |
| `Stux-www.bin` | Web UI only, for updating the frontend independently |

---

## WiFi Behavior

1. On boot, attempts to connect to the configured WiFi network (stored in NVS)
2. Retries up to 3 times on failure
3. Falls back to an open access point (`Stux-AP`) if all retries fail
4. Connect to the AP and access the web UI to configure WiFi credentials

The status LED reflects connection state:
- **Fast blink** — Booting / initializing
- **Solid** — Connected to WiFi
- **Slow blink** — Running in AP fallback mode

---

## Settings

All settings are stored in NVS (non-volatile storage) and configurable through the web UI's Settings page. The settings table is defined in [`SettingsDefs.h`](main/Application/SettingsManager/SettingsDefs.h):

```cpp
inline const SettingDef SETTINGS_DEFS[] = {
    { "wifi.ssid",      SettingType::String, "WiFi SSID",      "" },
    { "wifi.password",  SettingType::String, "WiFi Password",  "" },
    { "device.name",    SettingType::String, "Device Name",    "Stux" },
    { "mqtt.enabled",   SettingType::Bool,   "MQTT Enabled",   "0" },
    { "mqtt.broker",    SettingType::String, "MQTT Broker",    "" },
    // ... add your own settings here
};
```

The web UI auto-generates form fields for each entry. Adding a new setting is one line.

---

## Hardware Layer

The `hardware/` directory contains everything that changes when you swap the board or add a peripheral.

### BoardConfig.h

Edit [`BoardConfig.h`](main/hardware/BoardConfig.h) to match your board's pin assignments:

```cpp
namespace BoardConfig
{
    static constexpr int STATUS_LED_PIN = 2;          // GPIO2 on most ESP32 DevKits
    static constexpr bool STATUS_LED_ACTIVE_HIGH = true;

    // Add your pins:
    // static constexpr int MODBUS_TX_PIN = 17;
    // static constexpr int SPI_MOSI_PIN  = 13;
}
```

### StatusLed (example driver)

[`StatusLed.h`](main/hardware/StatusLed.h) is a minimal but functional hardware driver included as a starting point. It demonstrates:

- Reading pin configuration from `BoardConfig.h`
- Using `lib/rtos` (Timer) for blink patterns
- A clean, self-contained driver API

Use this as a pattern when adding your own drivers (display, sensors, motor control, etc.).

## Making It Yours

This is a template — copy it, rename it, and build on top of it:

1. **Rename the project** in `CMakeLists.txt` (`project(YourProject)`) and `.github/workflows/release.yml`
2. **Update `BoardConfig.h`** with your board's pin assignments
3. **Add your hardware drivers** in `hardware/` (display drivers, sensor interfaces, protocol adapters)
4. **Add your application logic** as new managers in `Application/` (see below)
5. **Extend the web UI** — add pages in `frontend/src/pages/`, register routes in the sidebar
6. **Add commands** for your features so the frontend and MQTT can interact with them
7. **Add settings** by adding entries to `SettingsDefs.h`

### Adding a New Manager

1. Create a new directory under `Application/YourManager/`
2. Implement your manager class, accepting `ServiceProvider&` in the constructor
3. Add it to `ServiceProvider.h` (forward declare + virtual getter)
4. Add it to `ApplicationContext.h` (member + getter implementation)
5. Call `Init()` from `main.cpp`
6. Register source files in `main/CMakeLists.txt`

### Adding a New Command

Commands are dispatched by `CommandManager`. Add an entry to the command table with a type string and handler function. The handler receives a JSON payload and writes its response to a `JsonWriter`. The frontend calls it via the WebSocket RPC layer in `backend.ts`.

### Adding a Hardware Driver

1. Define pins in `hardware/BoardConfig.h`
2. Create your driver in `hardware/` (e.g., `hardware/display/MyDisplay.h`)
3. Use the driver from your manager in `Application/`
4. Add include paths and component dependencies in `main/CMakeLists.txt`

See [`StatusLed.h`](main/hardware/StatusLed.h) for a complete example.
